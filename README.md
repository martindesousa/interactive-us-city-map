# interactive-us-city-map

This project is an interactive US city map website that allows you to watch the cities in the United States grow (or shrink) from 1790-2020. The data points are all based on U.S. Census data from each decennial. On the site, you have the option to use a slider which will pick the year for you. For each data point, you can see the name of the city and the state it was in. 

# Notes: 

Some data is spotty and is being fixed, such as in old cities which may have coordinate position issues, or cities which were in states which changed over time (ie, Wheeling, West Virginia was part of Virginia before West Virginia split off).
